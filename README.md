# Human Activity Recognition using Random Forest

This repository contains the R script and results for classifying human activity based on accelerometer and gyroscope data. For Midterm #1

## Files

- `Midterm#1.Rmd`: Rmarkdown for training, evaluation, and generating results of test data.
- `binary_yinbow.txt`: Binary classification results.
- `multiclass_yinbow.txt`: Multiclass classification results.

## Instructions to Reproduce Results

1. Make sure you have R installed on your machine.
2. Install the required package: `randomForest`.
3. Download the training_data.txt and test_data.txt files and place them in the same folder as the `Midterm#1.Rmd` Rmarkdown.
4. Run the `Midterm#1.Rmd` Rmarkdown.
5. The Rmarkdown file will generate `binary_yinbow.txt` and `multiclass_yinbow.txt` files containing the binary and multiclass classification results, respectively.
